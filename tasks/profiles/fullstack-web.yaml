        explanation: |
          **nvm** is the most widely used - great compatibility, large community.
          Shell startup is slightly slower (~200ms).

          **fnm** is faster (written in Rust) with the same features.
          Recommended if shell speed matters to you.

          **Bun** is a new all-in-one tool (runtime + package manager + bundler).
          Very fast, but newer and less mature.

          For most developers, **nvm** or **fnm** are safe choices.

        explanation: |
          Docker lets you run applications in isolated containers.
          You might need it if:
          - Your project uses docker-compose for local services
          - You want to match production environment exactly
          - You need to run databases/services without installing them

          If you're unsure, you can always add Docker later.

        action: "explain"
        explanation: |
          **Git config** sets your name and email for commits.

          **SSH keys** let you push/pull without entering passwords.
          The key is stored in your macOS Keychain for security.

          **GitHub CLI (gh)** lets you work with GitHub from terminal:
          create PRs, clone repos, etc.

          Recommended: Set up all three for the smoothest experience.
