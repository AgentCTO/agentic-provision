    question: "How would you like to manage Python versions?"
    options:
      - letter: "A"
        text: "pyenv - Simple Python version management"
        tasks: ["pyenv"]

        text: "Not sure - What's the difference?"
        action: "explain"
        explanation: |
          **pyenv** is lightweight - just manages Python versions.
          You install packages with pip. Most flexible approach.

          **mise** manages Python plus other languages (Node, Ruby, etc.)
          Good if you work with multiple languages.

          **Anaconda** is a full distribution with 250+ packages pre-installed.
          Includes conda package manager. Larger download (~3GB).

          For most data scientists, **pyenv** or **Anaconda** work well.
          pyenv for flexibility, Anaconda for convenience.

        action: "explain"
        explanation: |
          Docker is useful for data science when:
          - Running databases locally (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
          - Using GPU-enabled ML containers
          - Reproducing exact environments
          - Running services like MLflow, Jupyter servers

          If you're just getting started, you can skip Docker for now.
