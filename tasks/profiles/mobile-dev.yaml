        explanation: |
          **React Native**: Use JavaScript/TypeScript skills for mobile.
          Great if you know web development. Large ecosystem.

          **Flutter**: Google's UI toolkit using Dart language.
          Excellent performance, beautiful UI, growing fast.

          **Native iOS**: Swift/SwiftUI for pure Apple development.
          Best performance, full platform access, Apple-only.

          For web developers: React Native is natural.
          For best cross-platform UI: Flutter.
          For iOS-only apps: Native Swift.
